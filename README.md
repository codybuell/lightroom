 - figure out how to use shift button to make multiple selections
 - figure out how to show status of rating and color label
 - add a toggle b&w vs color button
 - show labels, flags and ratings, history??
 - setup some profiles to toggle mappings and reduce pages and enlarge dials,  ie hsl faders (all other mappings would be the same though)
